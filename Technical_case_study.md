# Technical Case Study

Your mission is to build a data pipeline to feed our sales team with as many qualified brand leads as possible. This pipeline will include the following steps: 
sourcing/scraping: find and get relevant data from one or more sources 
enrichment: enrich the data with additional information that might be needed or important [OPTIONAL!] 
scoring: score the leads to determine the ones that must be attacked 
sending: send the new leads to our sales pipeline 

In this case, you’ll need to: 
- Define important information to send to our sales (mandatory and recommended fields) - Choose a source of your choice you’d like to get data from - Use an API of your choice to enrich that data with additional information [OPTIONAL!] 
- Propose a deduplication process (no need to implement it with fake data, just let us know step by step how you would do it)

Please send in your results (data + script).
